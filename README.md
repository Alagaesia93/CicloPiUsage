# CicloPiUsage

This is a Pyspark project about forecasting bike rentals in Pisa, Italy.

This project has been developed for my Big Data Analytics exam, Data Science and Business Informatics course (https://www.di.unipi.it/it/didattica/wds-lm). 

Pyspark 2.3.1

How it works

In the relation.pdf file there is an article explaining the usage. In short: 1st WeatherPreprocessing 2nd JoinWeatherAndCicloPi 3rd TrainingAndTesting. Please add to the generated weather.csv columns about holidays by hand.
